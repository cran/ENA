Description: Ensemble network aggregation is an approach which leverages the
    inverse-rank-product (IRP) method to combine networks. This package
    provides the capabilities to use IRP to bootstrap a dataset using a single
    method, to aggregate the networks produced by multiple methods, or to
    aggregate the networks produced on different datasets.
